# Word-Cloud-for-reviews
This is a code for generating Wordcloud from the review dataset of Coursera
I scraped the website of Coursera and pre-labelled the dataset depending on their rating. For a 5-star rating, the review was labelled as Very Positive, Positive for 4-star, Neutral for 3-star, Negative for 2-star, and Very Negative for 1-star. There are 2 files, reviews.tsv and reviewsbycourse.tsv. The reviews.tsv file has no grouping, just the course reviews and their corresponding label. For the reviewsbycourse.tsv, they are grouped by the CourseId column.
